# Program Features

<views.py> is the main program and the only program that should be accessed directly.
Lessons can be added using the Add Lesson function; these lessons can then be added to the calender by clicking on the period and adding a Lesson Plan to create the agenda. The lessons are stored in lessons.json; the agenmda is stored in agenda.json.

# Disclaimer

This program works with a rotating block schedule of 7 classes, with many features specific to the school it was created for. If using for other schools, adjustments will be needed.

Windows programs set to zoom at 150% will cause minor visual issues.
